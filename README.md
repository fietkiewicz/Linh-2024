# Linh-2024
Year #2 of summer research with Linh Tran

1. hex_friction: Add friction and mass to the hexapod and study how it affects walking.
2. cpp: Make a C++ version of the NEURON/Mujoco simulation from 2023. We want to see if it's faster than Python.
3. hex_control1: Has manual entry of parameters for force and angle for hexapod (hex_manual.py) and program to control hexapod in direction (user steers using arrow keys -- hex_control.py)
4. hex_control2: Has the manual entry for parameters for force and angle for hexapod, for every legs instead of two set of legs in hex_control_1
5. hex_rangefinder: Has the program that has a programmed hexapod to follow the ball using rangefinder
6. hexapod1: Program trying to have the hexapod walk in a big circle
8. hexapod_2023: Original hexapod1 from last year
9. hexapodview: Program that has the camera follow the object/hexapod
10. rat_legs: Waking rat legs
11. rat_legs2: Better walking rat legs with friction
